There are python scripts that deal with frm.dat.

scaling2form.py creates a double-columned text file with
qz and |F(qz)| values. This removes the need to use
the SDP program to create a form factor.

frm_box.py creates par files needed to extract the scaling
factor. The box will be tall and iter will be set to 1.
